==Abstract==

This PEPE specifies the off-chain relay network used to augment the Phantasma blockchain.

==Motivation==

The blockchain has several use-cases however it is not a panacea solution that should be used for everything.
Specially anything that requires low latency is a bad fit for blockchain, due to waiting times introduced by mempool and block generation.
A good example is a chat application, where users prefer the messages to be instantly delivered instead of waiting several seconds or even minutes for messages to arrive.
Phantasma provides a mechanism to distribute messages off-chain, while using the cryptograhic primitives provided by the blockchain.

==Specification==

The Phantasma Relay provides several features:
- Message delivery: Encrypted message communication between two Phantasma addresses
- Bargaining system: Off-chain matching engine useful for multiple situations (check PEPE-18 and PEPE-48)
- Discovery service:  Keyword-based discovery mechanism (check PEPE-56)

==Implementation==

The .NET module "Phantasma.P2P" includes the Relay class that implements the system described by this PEPE.
The Phantasma App implements a frontend for the messaging system described in this PEPE.
