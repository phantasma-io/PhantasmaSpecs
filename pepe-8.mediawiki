==Abstract==

This PEPE specifies the concept of Nexus in the Phantasma blockchain.

==Motivation==

Phantasma is a complex blockchain where multiple side-chains coexist. It is necessary to have something that unifies and connects all chains together, and that is the concept called Nexus.

==Specification==

The Nexus is a singular entitity where the global shared state of Phantasma is stored. It works as a central repository from where it is possible to fetch lists of existing chains and tokens.
A Nexus also has a unique name, which is included on each transaction, in order to prevent a specific transaction to be copied from a test enviroment and applied in another location.
Thus the official public Nexus has the name of "mainnet", the official development Nexus has the name of "testnet", and local development nexus will usually adopt the "simnet" name.
It is possible for the Phantasma technology to be used as an enterprise private consortium , where a custom unique Nexus name can be used.
