==Abstract==

This PEPE specifies the details of a transaction used in Phantasma chain.

==Motivation==

As most blockchains, a Phantasma block can contain several transactions, which represent a state change in the chain data. It is necessary to define a format that is both compact and flexible enough for general usage.

==Specification==

The binary format of a Phantasma transaction is the following:

{|
!style="text-align:left;"| Name
!Size
 Description
|-
|Nexus name
|varstring
|Name of the nexus where the transaction has effect.
|-
|Chain name
|varstring
|Name of the chain where the transaction has effect.
|-
|Script 
|varbyte
|Phantasma VM script that represents the content of the transaction.
|-
|Expiration
|4
|UNIX timestamp of when a transaction expires. A transaction can not be included in a block if the block timestamp occurs after the transaction expiration.
|-
|Signature Count
|varint
|Number of signatures attached to the transaction.
|}

Then follows a list of signatures based on the Signature Count field:
