==Abstract==

This PEPE specifies the token routing system employed in Phantasma blockchain.

==Motivation==

Sometimes might be useful to automate certain actions in the blockchain, like calling a contract every time a certain action or event triggers.

==Specification==

TODO

==Fee Mechanism==

An automatic system like this has potential for abuse if fully unconstrained, however the system used in Phantasma required that a fee is paid for each triggered action.
Cascading actions will then quickly drain the energy from the trigger owner, unless limits are put into place.

==Contract ABI==

TODO 

==Implementation==

TODO more info
