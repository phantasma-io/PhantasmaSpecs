==Abstract==

This PEPE specifies the details of a block used in Phantasma chain.

==Motivation==

As any blockchain, Phantasma content is represented as sequence of blocks, each one linked to the previous. It is necessary to define a format that is both compact and flexible enough for general usage.

==Specification==

The binary format of a Phantasma block is the following:

{|
!style="text-align:left;"| Name
!Size
 Description
|-
|Height
|4
|Heigh of the block.
|-
|Timestamp 
|4
|Unix timestamp of the block.
|-
|Previous Hash 
|32
|Hash of the previous block.
|-
|Chain Address
|32
|Address of the chain where the block was minted.
|-
|Transaction Count
|2
|Number of transaction inside the block.
|}

Then follows a list of entries based on the Transaction Count field:

{|
!style="text-align:left;"| Name
!Size
 Description
|-
|Hash
|32
|Hash of transaction.
|-
|Event Count 
|2
|Amount of events in the transaction.
|-
|Events 
|N
|List of events.
|}

Finally, the last field is the Payload, which is a variable length byte array.
