==Abstract==

This PEPE specifies the details of a EdDSA signature as used in the Phantasma chain.


==Motivation==

In public-key cryptography, Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) is a digital signature scheme using a variant of Schnorr signature based on Twisted Edwards curves.[1] It is designed to be faster than existing digital signature schemes without sacrificing security.
Phantasma preferred signature scheme is Ed25519, which is a EdDSA signature scheme using SHA-512 and Curve25519.
Besides the speed benefits, there are also some security benefits. One of the more interesting security benefits is that it is immune to several side channel attacks.
No secret array indices. The code never reads or writes data from secret addresses in RAM; the pattern of addresses is completely predictable. The code is therefore immune to cache-timing attacks, hyperthreading attacks, and other side-channel attacks that rely on leakage of addresses through the CPU cache.
No secret branch conditions. The code never performs conditional branches based on secret data; the pattern of jumps is completely predictable. The code is therefore immune to side-channel attacks that rely on leakage of information through the branch-prediction unit.
