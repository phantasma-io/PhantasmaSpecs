==Abstract==

This PEPE specifies the governance system of the Phantasma blockchain.

==Motivation==

It is often desired to have a governance method in a trustless system, to allow the users to decide the outcome of events, or change public parameters fairly, in way that eliminates or at least minimizes the collusion between intervening parties.

==Specification==

Phantasma provides a native contract ABI that allows an issue to be proposed and then voted by users, until an outcome is decided.
The voting system calculates the voting power of each user by taking into account their staked token amount, modified by a quadratic function, in order to reduce the amount of power that can be exerted by groups owning a large stake.

==Implementation==

The .NET module "Phantasma.Blockchain" includes the GovernanceContract class that implements the ABI described by this PEPE.
The Phantasma App implements a frontend for the voting system described in this PEPE.
