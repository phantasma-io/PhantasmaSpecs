==Abstract==

This PEPE specifies the concept of fungible token as applied to the Phantasma blockchain.

==Motivation==

A fungible token is a cryptographic token that is emitted on the blockchain by an entity which determines a supply. The fungible aspect means that each token of the same type is completly equal to another.

==Specification==

The Phantasma blockchain has native support for fungible tokens, which can be created with certain parameters like name and supply.
A specific address becames the token administrator with capacity to mint new tokens (as specified by the supply). The minting of tokens is a completly transparent action visible in the blockchain.

==Contract Methods==

A fungible token implements the following ABI:
