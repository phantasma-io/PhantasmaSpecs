==Abstract==

This PEPE specifies the format used by Phantasma account addresses.

==Motivation==

As most blockchains, Phantasma represents a user by an account address. The address is used as the public way of exchanging transactions and other info using Phantasma.

==Specification==

The address is actually a derivation of the public-private keypair used by accounts. The following algoritm can be used to generate a Phantasma address from a public key:

# Take the 32 bytes that make the public key and prefix it with the byte 74.
# Use base58 encoding on the previous step to obtain the address

TODO explain base58, checksums etc
